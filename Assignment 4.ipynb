So that column needs encoding which I did above but then realized that I could put that into the pipeline so I left the original code but included it in the pipeline below.

I chose decision tree because its more simple and with control of the depth and other hyperparameters, we can get decent results without it being too slow. Gradient Boosted was chosen because it should be able to make up where the decision tree is lacking and give a better result, which it did. And then for the linear model I chose ridge because it was simple. I tried to make a Support Vector Machine model work on my dataset but I kept getting errors during the grid search that I could not figure out so I gave up and went with something simple, and it still had a decent score of 84% on the training accuracy. \n",

The gradient boosted machine worked the best and I think that makes sense because we know it does very well for non-linear data without overfitting and do well on continuous values which is what most of the dataset consists of. The parameter grid was actually good for this model because it allowed me to put in different hyperparameters into the GBM and then tell me which one was the best, which was max depth of 5 and n_estimators of 100.

So in step 3 I just did the basic calls for each of the models and didn't play with the hyperparameters, and we can see that both the decision tree is definitely overfitting, training r2 score of 1.00 which is not good. The grid search allowed to change the hyperparameters more. The train score is still 0.99 for the gradient boosted machine which does lend itself that it may be overfitting. \n",
